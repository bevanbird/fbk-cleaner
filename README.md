Field Book Extraction Utility

This is a small, desktop based utility that will help the user quickly and easily clean their raw survey data in FBK format and prepare the data for network adjustment and drafting.

It will help you fix common problems in the data.

The end result of using the utility will be an output of two separate field book files. One file will contain only the control network, the other file will contain all of the side shots.

The utility will check each recorded observation and determine if it is useful for improving the accuracy of the control network. The utility should be able to recognize mislabled observations, GPS observations, low quality observations, and bad "busted" observations.

The main contributors are Bevan Bird and Michael Schaff.
