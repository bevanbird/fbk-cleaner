We want to save a copy of this file with -edit.fbk or something like that - because we're going to make edits - the software will do things automatically, but will work with the user interactively where necessary.

The errors in the data collection are fixed while using our application - these changes are saved in the -edit file.

The -edit file is used to generate the control network FBK, and later when we get to it, also the sideshots FBK file.

We might as well have the application do this step of duplicating the raw FBK file (making the new -edit file) so the user has one less step to do. (This behaviour - for example the suffix to use - can be customized in a config file.)
